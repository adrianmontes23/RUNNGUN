As of writing this it's Thursday 12:16 AM, 5/20/21, I am proud of the work I've done
hopefully whoever is reading this can beat the game (The key is patceine(sorry don't know how to spell))
I worked hard and it really did pay off.
Seeing all the things we did in the past was the most exhillerating part.
This was a fun project, which I hope I don't get too much points off. Oh wait I just
remembered you said we had a day of Grace, hopefully that applies to this.
Im just typing off the top of my head right before I submit this.
I just wanted to say thank you Mr. Hudson even though we didn't have Zooms,
I believe you were my best KVA teacher. You had everything organized for us and 
you always answered my emails no matter the time of the day. Thank you one last time
and I hope to see you next year.

Post Script: 
I just remembered that in the tutorial video I didn't include anything
about how the longer you hold the W key the higher you jump. But I think people could
figue that out. Thanks one last time and good night for me at least.
Oh and I made the video using HitFilm Express. When you mentioned we would be using
Gimp I was so excited because the year before I used Gimp on almost a daily so I 
already knew all the basics and some advanced features.
Ok for real now, Good Night.
